In this project I am hoping to accomplish several ideas

I'd like to be able to have several working "if" and "for" statements that allow for the randomization of several factors.

These variables should then be randomized to give a completely unpredictable string of letters, number, and symbols which will be used to create a password.

There should be user choices of both how long the password should be as well as what type of characters to include.

The program should all be linked to an event listener for click to start the function.
